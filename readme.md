## Steps

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

 - Install ts-loader by yarn or npm
 - add or edit tsconfig.json file 
 - edit webpack.mix.js
 - Create source like in this example
 
 To try this example download the package and do: 
 
 1) composer install 
 2) php artisan key:generate
